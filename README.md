# Warning 

It is an old version of quandarium. I am developing the 1.0.0 version and I will release it soon together with more information about quandarium.

# Quandarium 

This package present several tools to deal with Quantum Chemistry (QC) data of molecular systems (non-periodic): 
* Extraction from QC calculations;
* Molecular analysis, seuch as effective coordination bonds and exposed area;
* AtoMF (Atomic to Molecular Featurization);
* Correlation analysis and correlation significance analysis with bootstrap.
